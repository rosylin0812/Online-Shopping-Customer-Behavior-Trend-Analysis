## Business Problem
As apart of the marketing department for an online superstore, we have been tasked to identifying poorly performing products to focus marketing efforts towards.

## Objective
Based on the business’ historical data, we will provide e-commerce analytics that our company can use to make more intelligent decisions to boost profits and minimize losses by identifying:
* Top selling products/categories
* Most/least profitable products 
* Profit/loss by discount level

[Most/least profitable products & Profit/loss by discount level](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fangju4276/viz/OnlineShoppingCustomerBehaviorTrendAnalysis-2/Dashboard2)

## Summary
* Bottom five products that are ranked based on profits are selling at a loss.
  * Worst-performing products: Printers & Tables
* Furniture is roughly the same quantity as technology, but only generating  6% of the profit.
* Technology and office supplies contribute to 51% and 43% of profit respectively.
* Company’s breakeven discount rate is roughly 24%.

## Recommendations
* Maintain discount rate to sell off items
* Refrain from offering similar products
* Discontinue selling and take the loss
* Increase advertising to increase overall sales 
    
    -> Divert effort to products categorized as furniture and those select few printers that are performing poorly
